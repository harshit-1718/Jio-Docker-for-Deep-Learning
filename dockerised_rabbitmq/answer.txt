[CLS] year of discovery ? [SEP] a black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it . [ 2 ] the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the boundary of no escape is called the event horizon . although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity . [ 5 ] in many ways , a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . this temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes , making it essentially impossible to observe directly . objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by john michell and pierre - simon laplace . [ 8 ] in 1916 , karl schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole . david finkelstein , in 1958 , first published the interpretation of " black hole " as a region of space from which nothing can escape . black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity ; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity . the discovery of neutron stars by jocelyn bell burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality . the first black hole known was cygnus x - 1 , identified by several researchers independently in 1971
